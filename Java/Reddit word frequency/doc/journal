ALTERNATIVE IDEAS:
==================
** SelectUtil currently O(nlogn), can be O(n). Partial sort/quickselect. Either faster execution with partial sort
or since already fully sorted with O(nlogn) calculate it immediately on frequency creation, store it and retrieve
on query 
- don't replace ' in the sentence if it is inside words => difference of (don't) and (dont)
- exctracting of comments except by parsing JSON can be done by matching String for '"body": "(...)"'. Probably not better approach and has more than few corner cases.
